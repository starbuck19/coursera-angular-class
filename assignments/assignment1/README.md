Implements lunch checker app that counts the number of items for lunch and prints the "Enjoy" message if number of items is less or equal to 3. If number of items is greater than 3, then the "Too much!" message is printed. Empty items do not count towards total lunch items count. "Please enter data first" is printed if input field is empty. Bonus features implemented (different border and text color for the message printed depending on the message)
